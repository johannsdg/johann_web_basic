    <h1>Welcome to Johann!</h1>
    Johann is a lightweight and flexible “scenario orchestrator”.<br />
    It makes it easy to coordinate the actions of groups of computers into cohesive,
    reconfigurable scenarios.<br />
    It’s sort of like the conductor for an orchestra of computers, and you get to write
    the music.<br />
